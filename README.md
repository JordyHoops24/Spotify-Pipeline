🎧 Spotify Big Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes extended Spotify streaming history using Hive, HDFS, and Big Data SQL techniques.
The goal is to process large Spotify JSON data exports, clean them into CSV format, load them into HDFS, and run Hive queries to extract meaningful insights about listening behavior over multiple years.

This repository contains:

Cleaned CSV datasets

Hive SQL scripts

Instructions for loading data into Hive

Queries for analytics

📦 Dataset Source

The raw data comes from Spotify’s Extended Streaming History, downloaded from:
https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/

Spotify provides JSON files such as: 

Streaming_History_Audio_2023-2024.json
Streaming_History_Audio_2022.json
Streaming_History_Audio_2015-2018.json
 And so on



1. spotify_time.csv is used for time based analysis

| ts                   | platform | ms_played |
| -------------------- | -------- | --------- |
| 2025-07-06T06:17:14Z | ios      | 108981    |


2. spotify_tracks.csv is used for tracks/artist analysis



🗄️ Loading Data into HDFS


hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/<your_username>/spotify_new

hdfs dfs -put data/spotify_time.csv /user/<your_username>/spotify_new/
hdfs dfs -put data/spotify_tracks.csv /user/<your_username>/spotify_new/
 

Afterwards verify: hdfs dfs -ls /user/<your_username>/spotify_new


Creating Hive Tables:

Table 1: spotify_time

CREATE TABLE spotify_time (
    ts STRING,
    platform STRING,
    ms_played BIGINT
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE;

LOAD DATA INPATH '/user/<your_username>/spotify_new/spotify_time.csv'
INTO TABLE spotify_time;



Table 2: spotify_tracks

CREATE TABLE spotify_tracks (
    ts STRING,
    track STRING,
    artist STRING
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE;

LOAD DATA INPATH '/user/<your_username>/spotify_new/spotify_tracks.csv'
INTO TABLE spotify_tracks;



Analysis Queries (SQL)


All SQL queries are stored inside the SQL folder, below is a summary of each analysis.

1. Top 10 Tracks Per Year

SELECT year,
       track,
       artist,
       plays
FROM (
    SELECT
        SUBSTR(ts,1,4) AS year,
        track,
        artist,
        COUNT(*) AS plays,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY SUBSTR(ts,1,4)
            ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
        ) AS rn
    FROM spotify_tracks
    GROUP BY SUBSTR(ts,1,4), track, artist
) t
WHERE rn <= 10
ORDER BY year, plays DESC;


2. Top 10 Artist Per Year

SELECT year,
       artist,
       plays
FROM (
    SELECT
        SUBSTR(ts,1,4) AS year,
        artist,
        COUNT(*) AS plays,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY SUBSTR(ts,1,4)
            ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
        ) AS rn
    FROM spotify_tracks
    GROUP BY SUBSTR(ts,1,4), artist
) t
WHERE rn <= 10
ORDER BY year, plays DESC;


3. Listening Time by Hour of Day


SELECT 
    CAST(SUBSTR(ts,12,2) AS INT) AS hour,
    ROUND(SUM(ms_played)/3600000, 2) AS hours
FROM spotify_time
WHERE ts IS NOT NULL 
  AND SUBSTR(ts,12,2) IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY CAST(SUBSTR(ts,12,2) AS INT)
ORDER BY hour;


4. Listening Time by Platform (Device)

SELECT 
    LOWER(platform) AS platform_clean,
    ROUND(SUM(ms_played)/3600000, 2) AS hours
FROM spotify_time
GROUP BY LOWER(platform)
ORDER BY hours DESC;
